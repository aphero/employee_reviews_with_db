# Employee Reviews with a Database

## What it do

Creates a database of employees and departments and then uses it to give reviews and decide whether an employee is worthy of a raise.

## How it do

Uses SQLite and Active Record to manage a database containing Employees and Departments.  Employees are assigned pre-generated reviews, then those reviews are parsed to count keywords that will decide whether the employee has been naughty or nice.  If nice, give that man (or lady) a cookie!

## I do?

I didn't, really.  Spent a considerable amount of time picking apart Active Record, which cut into my assignment time too much.  All of the supplied tests passed, but I wasn't able to create any new ones.
